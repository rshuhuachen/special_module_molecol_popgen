Please don’t hestitate to ask David or Rebecca any questions throughout the course.\nIf anything is unclear or not working, please let us know!\nEach session will contain text, exercises and answers. We encourage you to really think before you reveal the answer, otherwise you won’t learn. If you need any help getting to the answer, you can also ask us questions to put you in the right direction. The same applies to helping you troubleshoot, of course.\nRemember, even the experts will google how to code things. Once you get more fluent in the language, you can do simple things by heart. But just like learning any langauge, this takes time and practise. So don’t be afraid to look into your notes or look up how to do things, this is how every person works in R\n\n\n\nUse the resources available to you!",

We have given you access to DataCamp, a great interactive platform to learn R at any level. The courses we would like you to complete because they prepare you with all you need to know to follow the rest of the course are as follows:\nPlease follow them at your own speed. If you think something is too easy because you already have some prior experience, you can skip through it and learn at your own speed. Feel free to start other courses too. All we want you to be able to do, is gain the skills and experience to be able to complete the exercises below. These exercises are therefore not graded in any way, it’s just a way to make sure you understand the basics to continue with the rest of the course.",

What does the .csv extension mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nCsv stands for comma separated file. It is a file format to store tables (such as Excel files), where each line represents a data record, and fields are separated by commas. CSV files are commonly used to store data, but you have to be careful if your data contains text that might include comma’s, because it will think the sentence needs to be split up into different fields! Other ways to separate fields are for example by using tabs ( or spaces.\n\n\n\n\nImport the data set and assign it to a variable (called e.g. data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode and answer\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are working within an R project, so we can use relative path names. If you prefer using the absolute path name, this might look different. Also, path specification is dependent on your operating system. This has been done in iOS (Apple), but Windows looks different.\n\n\nCode\n# using read.csv\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"../data/NCD_RisC_Lancet_2020_height_child_adolescent_global.csv\")\n\n# or absolute path name\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"/Users/vistor/Documents/Work/GitHub/postdoc/special_module_molecol_popgen/data/NCD_RisC_Lancet_2020_height_child_adolescent_global.csv\") \n\n# or using read table, make sure you specify there's a header!\ndata &lt;- read.table(\"../data/NCD_RisC_Lancet_2020_height_child_adolescent_global.csv\", sep = \",\", header=T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many data entries are there?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode and answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nnrow(data) \n\n\n1050 entries because there are 1050 rows, excluding the header\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the youngest age group in the dataset, and what is the oldest age group (i.e. how old are those groups)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode and answer\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we need to know what columns there are in the data and what they are called, which can be done in different ways.\nRemember you can always view the data (by clicking on it in the environment or by calling View(data)).\n\n\nCode\n#this shows you just the structure of the table\nstr(data) \n\n#this tells you the column names of the table\nnames(data) \n\n# this shows you the first 6 entries and the column names\nhead(data) \n\n\nFrom this we can see that the column that stores the age is called Age.group\n\n\nCode\n# minimum age i.e. youngest age class\nmin(data$Age.group) \n\n# maximum age i.e. oldest age class\nmax(data$Age.group) \n\n\nSo 5 and 19, respectively.",

What’s causing this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode and answer\n\n\n\n\n\nA classic coding issue, “what’s up with my data”? Figuring out why something is not behaving as expected will happen most of the time you are coding. How do we diagnose the problem?\nWe can start by having a look at the data using e.g. View(data) and by doing some tests.\n\n\nCode\n# let's see what happens when we change the data class to numeric, and store this in a test variable.\n\ntest &lt;- as.numeric(data$Mean.height)  \n\n\nIt gives a warning which indicates it could not change one or more of the values to numeric so it had to be put to NA. Why?\nWhat sometimes works is to sort the column, this might help us diagnose what is happening in such a large table. When we look at View(data) / the data tab, we can click on the column Mean.height and it will sort it. Click on it again, and it will sort it in reverse order\nWhatever way you used, you might have identified the issue!\nThere are two “ERRORS” at row number 112, a boy of age class 1992 and age 11. This text is causing the error, as R doesn’t recognise this column as numeric now.\n\n\n\n\nFix the error and change the data class to numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode and answer\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can’t correct the value because we don’t know what happened with this boy’s height measurement. So let’s either remove the entire row or change the values to NA. You could do this manually by going into the raw data using e.g. Excel. But a better practise is by doing this in the code - this way we can always track exactly what we did, and others can see it too because it is documented.\nIn the first method below, we simply remove the 112’th row, so we remove the entire data point. It’s always smart to store something in a different variable if you remove something so you do not override the original data, I’m showing you an example here but we’ll continue with the ‘data’ variable as we know it’s all good.\nIn the second and third method, we remove the text “ERROR” and instead replace it with the ‘official’ NA value that R recognises as NA.\n\n\nCode\n## method 1\n# remove the row\ndata_clean &lt;- data[-112,] \n\n# then we change the data class to numeric and we do not get a warning\ndata_clean$Mean.height &lt;- as.numeric(data_clean$Mean.height) \n# same for the SE\ndata_clean$Mean.height.standard.error &lt;- as.numeric(data_clean$Mean.height.standard.error) \n\n## method 2\n# this is what we had done before and automatically put the 'character' ERROR as NA, you'll get a warning but now we know why\n\ndata$Mean.height &lt;- as.numeric(data$Mean.height) \n\n# same for the SE\ndata$Mean.height.standard.error &lt;- as.numeric(data$Mean.height.standard.error) \n\n## method 3\n\n# this is the same as above, but manually which is a bit longer and more complex\n\ndata$Mean.height[which(data$Mean.height==\"ERROR\")] &lt;- NA \ndata$Mean.height.standard.error[which(data$Mean.height.standard.error==\"ERROR\")] &lt;- NA \n\n# change to numeric, now we won't get a warning\ndata$Mean.height &lt;- as.numeric(data$Mean.height) \ndata$Mean.height.standard.error &lt;- as.numeric(data$Mean.height.standard.error) \n\n\nThere we go! It’s always good to check if things worked, so you can use e.g. str(data) now to check that R indeed changed the columns to numeric.",

If you want to know more details about how to use a function, you can use ?mean\n\n\nCode\n# we have to make sure we remove the NA when calculating the mean though!\nmean(data$Mean.height, na.rm = T) \n\n# or we use the data that doesn't contain the NA\nmean(data_clean$Mean.height) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the mean across years of the mean height, calculated separately for boys and girls?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode and answer\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s where your preference can kick in: do you want to use dplyr or something else, like base R or data.table? I will show you multiple options, just see what looks more intuitive to you. To make sure we can use dplyr, we have to load the library.\nTo answer this question, we have to do multiple steps: divide the data among the sexes somehow, and calculate the mean. This can be done in steps, or in one go. If you’re a computational scientists, you would want things to be done in as little code as possible. But since we are learning, just do what makes most sense to you.\n\n\nCode\n# method 1 with dplyr\nlibrary(dplyr) # we can use dplyr to use the filter option\n\ngirls &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(Sex == \"Girls\")\nboys &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(Sex == \"Boys\")\n\nmean(girls$Mean.height, na.rm = T) \nmean(boys$Mean.height, na.rm = T) \n\n# method 2 without dplyr\nmean(data$Mean.height[which(data$Sex == \"Girls\")], na.rm=T) \nmean(data$Mean.height[which(data$Sex == \"Boys\")], na.rm=T) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn what year was the standard error lowest for boys and girls separately, for the age class 12? (i.e. the variance smallest?)\n\nAgain, we need to take multiple steps here: only look at data from the Age group 12, and then look at what year the variance was the smallest (i.e. the minimal variance).\nI’ll only show you the dplyr way, but you can use many different methods to get to the same answer here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode and answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# method 1: with dplyr\ngirls_12yr &lt;- girls %&gt;% filter(Age.group == 12)\nboys_12yr &lt;- boys %&gt;% filter(Age.group == 12)\n\ngirls_12yr %&gt;% arrange(Mean.height.standard.error) %&gt;% head() # 2003, with a SE of 0.09367336\n\nboys_12yr %&gt;% arrange(Mean.height.standard.error) %&gt;% head() # 2004, with a SE of 0.1342430",

Bonus if you do it seperately per sex!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode and answer\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s get plotting! First choose: do you want to use ggplot2 (recommended) or base R to make your plot?\nBefore you start making code, think what elements should be on the axes. What should be on the X axis, what variable on the Y axis, and what type of graph would represent the data best? A boxplot, scatterplot, line graph, pie chart? Choose the right element accordingly and then start writing the code.\nWe also have to use a portion of the data only, again. We can use dplyr (filter()) but I will also show you another function here, subset() which is a base R function to do something similar to filter().\n\n\nCode\n# method 1: with ggplot\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(subset(data, Age.group == 18), aes(x = Year, y = Mean.height)) + geom_point(aes(col = Sex)) + geom_line(aes(col = Sex)) + theme_classic()\n\n# method 2: base R\n# subset the data\nage_18 &lt;- subset(data, Age.group == 18)\n\n# set up empty plot\nplot(\n  age_18$Year, age_18$Mean.height,\n  type = \"n\",\n  xlab = \"Year\",\n  ylab = \"Mean height\"\n)\n\n# add points and lines by Sex\nfor (s in levels(age_18$Sex)) {\n  ds &lt;- age_18[age_18$Sex == s, ]\n  \n  points(ds$Year, ds$Mean.height,\n         col = cols[s], pch = 16)\n  \n  lines(ds$Year, ds$Mean.height,\n        col = cols[s], lwd = 2)\n}\n\n# add legend\nlegend(\"topleft\",\n       legend = levels(as.factor(age_18$Sex)),\n       pch = 16,\n       lwd = 2,\n       bty = \"n\")\n\n\nAs we see, both the mean height of girls and boys aged 18 years increased over time. What is also clear is that base R is a lot longer, and you require a lot of separate elements.\n\n\n\nWell done! If you managed to answer all of the above, with or without some help from your notes and the internet, you’re ready to explore genetic data and answer some pop gen questions.",
